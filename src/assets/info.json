Geo-targeting is well suited for brick-and-mortar stores and service businesses operating within a specific region, for instance real estate agencies and other professional services. Your PPC ads show only to those within the geographic area that are setup within the campaign. As with a local newspaper, you are only advertising to the target audience who is likely to use your service or buy your product."

There are over 200 factors that affect search engine results placement, including such things as location, longevity of site, quality of inbound links, the competitiveness of the market and many many more. We target the best keywords for your business and use strategies to get you on the first page.

                What search terms or referral sites did visitors use to find the business?
                Am I missing an audience on the internet that might want to buy my products or services?
